# <span style="font-family:Monospace; font-size:2em;"> Hi üëãüèæ ~
 
<span style="font-size:1.5em; font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;">
  I'm a second year student at [MS Ramaiah Institue of Technology](https://www.msrit.edu/) pursuing my *Bachelor's of Engineering* in *Computer Science and Engineering*.
  I have always been fascinated by the marvels of technology and the way things just "work as intended" has always peaked my interest since I was a kid.
  Today as a student I have the opportunity and the resources to take a deep dive in this broad and ever expanding universe.
  My other interests include: 
  
  - Photography and photo-editting.
  - Live Streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hetstorm/about).
  - Listening to [Music](https://open.spotify.com/user/736tls537c5wkdxh0kst9i4hk?si=901de2e3d9924705).
  
## My Coding Journey
  I started coding when I was in 9th grade with python. I still remember the smile on my face when the console printed the **Hello World!** message. From then I just kept learning new things and making projects along the way.
