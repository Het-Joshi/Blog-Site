# Understanding the terms

## What is FLOSS?
`Free / Libre / Open Source Software` (FLOSS) is an umbrella term that comprises of **Free software**, **Libre Software** as well as **Open-Source Software**.  
FLOSS provides the user with a `high-level control` and ability to view and modify the `source-code` as compared to the proprietary software counterpart.

This freedom to explore, learn and spread that knowledge further is what makes the idea of FLOSS so brilliant and unique.

## What is 'Free Software'
Free Software does not refer to software 'free-of-cost' but rather uses the word  `Free as in Freedom`.  
This software respects the users' freedom, privacy and community. Now the question arises :

>**"Freedom from what exactly?"**

The answer to that question is covered in the *Four Essential Freedoms* which are upheld by every free software:

1.   The freedom to `run the program as you wish`, for any purpose (freedom 0).

2.  The freedom to `study how the program works, and change it` so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

3.  The freedom to `redistribute copies` so you can help others (freedom 2).

4.  The freedom to `distribute copies of your modified versions` to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
