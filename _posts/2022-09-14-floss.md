# Understanding the terms

## What is FLOSS?
   `Free / Libre / Open Source Software` (FLOSS) is an umbrella term that comprises of **[Free software](https://het-          joshi.github.io/blog/2022/09/14/floss.html#what-is-free-software)**, **Libre Software** as well as **Open-Source Software**.  
    FLOSS provides the user with a `high-level control` and ability to view and modify the `source-code` as compared to the proprietary software             counterpart. For the complete, official definition, visit [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html)

   This freedom to explore, learn and spread that knowledge further is what makes the idea of FLOSS so brilliant and unique.

## What is 'Free Software'  

![Free Software Foundation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96608251/190171456-c65fc41c-9eb9-4f8c-bb92-1120d1ffb5e1.png)  

   Free Software does not refer to software 'free-of-cost' but rather uses the word  `Free as in Freedom`.  
   This software respects the users' freedom, privacy and community. Now the question arises :
   
  <br>
   >**"Freedom from what exactly?"**  
  <br>
  
   The answer to that question is covered in the *Four Essential Freedoms* which are upheld by every free software:
  
   1.   The freedom to `run the program as you wish`, for any purpose (freedom 0).

   2.  The freedom to `study how the program works, and change it` so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a   precondition for this.

   3.  The freedom to `redistribute copies` so you can help others (freedom 2).

   4.  The freedom to `distribute copies of your modified versions` to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to  benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

   Although a huge amount of free software is indeed free of charge, and most developers of free software are volunteers, there is also a great amount  that  is not. For example, many distributions of the GNU/Linux system are paid for by the customer.
 
## What is Open-Source Software

 Open source software is different. Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter   it, or share it. LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program are examples of open source software.

As they do with proprietary software, users must accept the terms of a license when they use open source softwareâ€”but the legal terms of open source licenses differ dramatically from those of proprietary licenses.
 These licenses affect the way people can use, study, modify, and distribute software. In general, open source licenses grant computer users permission to  use open source software for any purpose they wish.
 
The Open Source Definition is used by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to determine if a license qualifies as a open-source license:
- Free redistribution
- Source code
- Derived works
- Integrity of the author's source code
- No discrimination against persons or groups
- No discrimination against fields of endeavor
- Distribution of license
- License must not be specific to a product
- License must not restrict other software
- License must be technology-neutral
