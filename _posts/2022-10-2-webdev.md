## Overview

This blogpost is a great resource for all those students and developers who are looking to get a head start on their Web-Development Journey.<br>
Below I have listed a plethora of resources that have personally helped me and ones that are the most refined and polished resources on the Internet.<br>
The best part is that many of these are <strong>absolutley free.</strong>

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths">The Odin Project</a> is a great resource to start your journey as a web-developer. They offer a unique User-interface and provide `two paths to choose from`!
<br>
You can either opt for the path with `Ruby on Rails` or stick with the traditional `Javascript` path. Obviously if you're feeling adventerous you could complete one branch and then also do the other one!
<br>
You also do get `projects` to work on and at the end of either branches there is a usefull `"Getting Hired" section` giving  usefull insights to interview questions and industry demands.
