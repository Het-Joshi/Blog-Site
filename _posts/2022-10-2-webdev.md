## Overview

This blogpost is a great resource for all those students and developers who are looking to get a head start on their Web-Development Journey.<br>
Below I have listed a plethora of resources that have personally helped me and ones that are the most refined and polished resources on the Internet.<br>
The best part is that many of these are <strong>absolutley free.</strong>
<br>
For further resources I have my `own community on discord` link for which is [here](https://discord.gg/hmb3EapDYK)

<b>Note:</b> There are many other good courses out there on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, etc. but it is to be kept in mind that these courses are `only but a tip of the iceberg` and will only teach you the basics of the subject. They provide a `pathway and a roadmap` but it is our part to put in extra effort and expand our knowledge via other resource beyond the scope of these 'bootcamps'.

## What IDE's to use?
The honest answer that I can give you is that it `dosen't matter` what you use as long as it suits your needs and way of work. That said I personally use Atom or VSCode with their extentions and packages.

## Ending Note
I hope that these resources are usefull to you and help you get a headstart in your web-development journey!
