# Understanding the terms
## What is FLOSS?
==Free / Libre / Open Source Software== (FLOSS) is an umbrella term that comprises of **Free software**, **Libre Software** as well as **Open-Source Software**.  
FOSS provides the user with a ==high-level control== and ability to view and modify the ==source-code== as compared to the propietry software counterpart.
This freedom to explore, learn and spread that knowledge further is what makes the idea of FLOSS so brilliant and unique.
